# DLL JSON-LD Formatter

This Drupal 10 custom module activates when the query string `?format=json-ld` is added to the end of the URL for nodes in any 
of the following four content types in the DLL Catalog's website:

- Author Authorities
- DLL Work
- Item Record (machine name: repository_item)
- Web Page

Instead of seeing the rendered HTML of the node, the user will see JSON-LD structured data.

This module was composed by Samuel J. Huskey.
